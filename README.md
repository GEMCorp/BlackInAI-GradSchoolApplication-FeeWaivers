## Notes

* This list is community-maintained. Please help keep it up-to-date!
* Please provide accurate and verifiable information. Link directly to the relevant program or department page whenever possible. Avoid general university websites.
* Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates to ensure consistency. Use "Ongoing" if there's no stated deadline *and the school doesn't recommend applying a certain number of days before the program deadline*.  Use "Check Program Deadline" if the school recommends applying for the fee waiver a certain number of days before the applicant's graduate program deadline. Please note that most schools recommend applying for the fee waiver a certain number of days before the applicant's graduate program deadline. This information, however, is mostly located in the fee waiver section of an application (not on the fee waiver information page). Be sure to apply early and open an issue or create a pull request by editing the deadline section in a row if the information contradicts what we have here (we primarily source our information from fee waiver information pages).
* Be as specific as possible about eligibility (e.g., "US Citizens or Permanent Residents only," "International students with F-1 visa," etc.).
* If the fee waiver information is on a separate page, link to *that specific page*, not the general admissions page.
* If you are unsure about any information, please leave a note in the "Specific Requirements" column or open an "Issue" on GitHub to discuss it.
* **Important:** Waiver deadlines are subject to change.  If a deadline listed is from the previous year, it likely applies to the previous application cycle.  Please update the deadline when the new application window opens.

## Issues
