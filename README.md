## Notes

* This list is community-maintained. Please help keep it up-to-date!
* Please provide accurate and verifiable information. Link directly to the relevant program or department page whenever possible. Avoid general university websites.
* Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates to ensure consistency. Use "Ongoing" if there's no stated deadline *and the school doesn't recommend applying a certain number of days before the program deadline*.  Use "Check Program Deadline" if the school recommends applying for the fee waiver a certain number of days before the applicant's graduate program deadline.
* Be as specific as possible about eligibility (e.g., "US Citizens and Permanent Residents only," "International students with F-1 visa," etc.).
* If the fee waiver information is on a separate page, link to *that specific page*, not the general admissions page.
* If you are unsure about any information, please leave a note in the "Specific Requirements" column or open an "Issue" on GitHub to discuss it.
* **Important:** Waiver deadlines can change.  If a deadline listed is from the previous year, it likely applied to the previous application cycle.  Please update the deadline when the new application window opens.
